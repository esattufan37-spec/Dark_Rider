# 🏎️ Raspberry Pi - Knight Rider LED Effect

This project simulates the classic "Knight Rider" (KITT) light animation using Raspberry Pi and Python. It utilizes the `RPi.GPIO` library to create a smooth, bouncing LED effect.

## 🛠️ Requirements
* 1 x Raspberry Pi (Any model)
* 5 x LEDs (Red recommended)
* 5 x 220Ω or 330Ω Resistors
* Jumper Wires
* Breadboard

## 🔌 Pinout & Wiring
The code uses the **BOARD** numbering system. Connect your LEDs to the following physical pins in this order:

| LED Order | Raspberry Pi Pin (Physical/Board) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1st LED | Pin 40 |
| 2nd LED | Pin 38 |
| 3rd LED | Pin 37 |
| 4th LED | Pin 36 |
| 5th LED | Pin 35 |
*(Don't forget to connect the GND!)*
